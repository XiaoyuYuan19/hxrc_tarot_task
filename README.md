1️⃣ How you would improve the overall user experience?
>User Experience Improvements:

- Switched to TailwindCSS for styling, enabling clear, clean, and maintainable UI updates.
- Applied responsive layout to ensure the application is usable and pleasant on both desktop and mobile.
- Added soft background colors, rounded corners, and clear typography for a modern and comforting aesthetic.
- Ensured card display scaling with appropriate aspect ratio (aspect-[4/3] on mobile and aspect-video on desktop) to avoid scroll issues while maintaining visual clarity.
- Arranged control buttons in a grid layout with consistent padding for better interaction.

✨ These improvements provide a clean, welcoming interface, making the tarot application easier and more comfortable to use across devices.

2️⃣ How to gamify the Tarot app if given a full week to develop?
>Gamification Ideas:

- Add daily tarot challenge: users draw a card daily and log reflections, creating habit engagement.
- Achievement system: e.g., “First Draw,” “10-Day Streak,” “Major Arcana Collector,” encouraging exploration.
- Flip animation + haptic vibration when revealing cards to enhance tactile interaction.
- Allow users to save spreads and write notes on interpretations for personal growth tracking.
- Add soft background music or ambient sounds during the card draw to increase immersion.
- Create shareable tarot spreads (image export) for social sharing while maintaining privacy.
- Build story mode spreads where users unlock spreads progressively, gamifying learning about tarot card meanings.

✨ These gamification ideas can increase user retention, encourage daily use, and deepen user engagement with the tarot app while maintaining its spiritual and reflective atmosphere.
