## 1️⃣ How you would improve the overall user experience?

> **User Experience Improvements:**

- Switched to **TailwindCSS** for styling, enabling clear, clean, and maintainable UI updates.
- Applied **responsive layout** to ensure the application is usable and pleasant on both desktop and mobile.
- Added soft background colors, rounded corners, and clear typography for a **modern and comforting aesthetic**.
- Ensured card display scaling with appropriate aspect ratio (`aspect-[4/3]` on mobile and `aspect-video` on desktop) to avoid scroll issues while maintaining visual clarity.
- Arranged control buttons in a grid layout with consistent padding for **better interaction**.
- **Implemented true Fisher-Yates shuffle logic**, ensuring each shuffle creates a truly randomized deck order, avoiding predictable sequences and enhancing authenticity for tarot readings.
- Added clickable card stack to trigger shuffle interactively, providing an intuitive experience for users wanting to reshuffle.
- **Added hover animations for dealt cards**: cards gently float forward on hover, enhancing visual feedback and interactivity without cluttering the interface.

✨ These improvements provide a **clean, welcoming interface**, make the tarot application easier and more comfortable to use across devices, and **improve functional reliability for authentic card draws while making interaction more engaging**.

## 2️⃣ How to gamify the Tarot app if given a full week to develop?

> **Gamification Ideas:**

- Add **daily tarot challenge**: users draw a card daily and log reflections, creating habit engagement.
- Achievement system: e.g., “First Draw,” “10-Day Streak,” “Major Arcana Collector,” encouraging exploration.
- Flip animation + haptic vibration when revealing cards to enhance tactile interaction.
- Allow users to **save spreads and write notes** on interpretations for personal growth tracking.
- Add soft background music or ambient sounds during the card draw to increase immersion.
- Create **shareable tarot spreads (image export)** for social sharing while maintaining privacy.
- Build **story mode spreads** where users unlock spreads progressively, gamifying learning about tarot card meanings.

✨ These gamification ideas can **increase user retention, encourage daily use, and deepen user engagement with the tarot app while maintaining its spiritual and reflective atmosphere**.
